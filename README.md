**Weather App Description**
**Overview**:
The weather app is a user-friendly web application designed to provide current weather information for a chosen location. It leverages HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript to fetch and display real-time weather data.

**Key Features**:

**User Input**:

The app typically includes a search bar or input field where users can enter the name of a city or provide geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude).
Weather Display:

Upon submitting the location, the app retrieves weather data from a weather API (such as OpenWeatherMap or Weatherstack) using JavaScript's Fetch API.
The retrieved data includes information like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a brief description of the weather conditions.

**Visual Representation:**

The app often uses icons or images to visually represent the current weather conditions, such as a sun for clear skies, clouds for overcast conditions, raindrops for rain, etc.

**Temperature Units:**

Users may have the option to switch between different temperature units, such as Celsius and Fahrenheit.

**Additional Information:**

Some weather apps display additional information like the minimum and maximum temperatures, sunrise and sunset times, and the date and time of the weather report.

**Responsive Design:**

The app is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

**CSS:**

Styles the app, making it visually appealing and ensuring a good user experience.

**JavaScript:**

Handles user input and triggers API requests to fetch weather data.
Dynamically updates the DOM to display the retrieved weather information.
Manages error handling for cases where the entered location is not found or the API request fails.
